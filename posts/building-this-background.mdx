# Building my background, pt.1

> Ossia: the subtle things are often the hardest.

<br />

I started building this portfolio as a part of my usual updates to my code and
software. I update it every so often, and it was due. Last update was sometime
in 2021. Three years was long enough.

This portfolio and blog project is also part of a 2024 goal I have: 24 blog
posts over the year, at a cadence 2 posts a month. Ambitious? Hardly.
Disciplined? I hope so. The overarching goal that I have is to encourage and
foster my own writing skills, accruing experience and building the muscle over
time. I enjoy writing both technical documentation and prose--this blog will
undoubtedly become a combination of both before all is said and done.

So, onto the actual meat of the subject:

## How I built the background for [chanceeakin.io](https://chanceeakin.io).

You've probably already visited the homepage, but in case you haven't, there's a
handy link featured above. I really enjoy generative art and programmatically
generated animations--this seemed like a cool way to explore the advancements in
the space, while presenting some challenges for myself.

I sought to accomplish the following:

- use three.js
- explore some WebGL shenanigans
- provide an atmospheric feeling to the blog
- incorporate randomness
- make the thing accessible, or as near to it as I could
- make it run fast

## Early Problems

- A lot of the Three.js ecosystem is (rightfully) built around vanilla JS. React
  likes to control the DOM, and WebGL is baked into the HTML `<canvas>` element.
- Backgrounds shouldn't be too noisy.

### Run fast

What does fast mean? How do we measure web page loading speed? I don't know how
y'all measure it, but I measure it by the urge to send my keyboard through my
monitor. Quantitatively, my monitor is more likely to receive the kiss of death
from my mechanical keyboard (Cherry MX Browns, naturually) when
[LCP](https://web.dev/articles/lcp) times appear north of 1000ms. ymmv.

So, the challenge was: load some cool 3D stuff as close to 1 second as possible.
Challenge accepted.

# Building the background, pt.3

February 24th, 2024

## Contents

## Recap

Last time, we dug into randomness and accessibility. _(Need to catch up?
[Check out the previous post](/blog/building-the-background-pt-2))._

## Performance

This time, we're digging into web performance. Let's break down how it went:

## React Server Components

This site, along with many others, is a [Next.js + React](https://nextjs.org/)
webpage, built and served via AWS Amplify. Most of the site is statically
generated, but some sections of the site utilize
[React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components).
Server components fall under the isomorphism umbrella. They make web site more
complicated, but they also make them faster. For instance, a server doesn't have
access to certain client side APIs, while the client has limited access to
protected server resources.

Luckily, Next.js takes most of the guess work out of isomorphic rendering with
their latest updates. So, we're using that for page speed increases.

The blog pages are all RSC. They're all fast. But if we're discussing the
background, why am I mentioning the blog? The blog has nothing to do with the
background! But it could.

## Webpack and the bundle

When we talk about frontend performance, the clearest culprit for slow
performance is often the easiest to solve: the size of the webpack bundle. In
older versions of React + Webpack (or Turbo, or whatever you use), code that
wasn't rendered on the server was loaded into one big file--called the bundle.
Bundles got big without proper pruning.

Webpack introduced [code
splitting(https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/), and React introduced
[lazy components](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy). Used together, these
two technologies make it easy to control how and when a bundle is split and
loaded. Instead of loading _all_ of the pages with the bundle (like loading the
blog with the home page), we only load the code we need for a given page.

Next.js makes code splitting a breeze. They split the bundle at every page, so
we gain common performance benefits with almost no effort. Here's what my bundle
looks like:

![Bundle view with chunks](/images/bg-pt3-bundle.png)

The first load for the `/` is 110kb. The largest TCP packet size is 64kb. The
first paint ships in 2 TCP packets. That's not too bad. Prior to code splitting,
some webpages would load 4+ mb of data and chuck up a loading spinner until it
was finished. Websites with that configuration load slow. Very slow.

If I did nothing else, this solves most of my perceived page speed issues. But
we're not done.

## React Suspense and gradual loading

### Suspense to the rescue

Suspense allows us to ship fallbacks, or loading/initial states for our
components. In my case, I ship a barebones title and a little bit of css
attached to it. This loads in around 380ms on desktop, and fills in while I
download the big ol' three.js bundle.

### LCP and Three.js

Because I'm utilizing React Suspense, my largest contentful paint doesn't occur
until my three.js bundle is completely loaded. In a nutshell, _I'm judged on the
complete load for SEO purposes, even though my FCP (first contentful paint)
occurs in half the time._ Kind of a bummer, but at least my users get some level
of feedback. And hey, I want a cool background on my site, so here we are.

My Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) occurs around 500ms on desktop, and full load
on 780ms. All in all, pretty solid for loading 5000 particles and animating them
via WebGL @ 60 frames per second.

## Rendering Performance

![Webpage performance & LCP](/images/bg3-lcp.png)

The page loads in two main chunks:

- My code (Next.js + content)
- Three.js code

In the above image, there are two main scripts being called: the Next.js code (+
my tiny additions), and the Three.js code. The FCP occurs around the time the
Three.js code processes, and the LCP occurs when the Three.js code processes.
The last bit is the Google Tag Manager, a non blocking script for page
performance. This screen cap shows the page taking 650ms for Largest Contentful
Paint of the background + page content.

## Conclusion

All in all, the site does quite a bit of work for a subtle effect. I like it,
and I hope you do too.

Next time, we'll cover something a bit different! Stay tuned.

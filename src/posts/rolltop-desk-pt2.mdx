# Rolltop Desk, part 2

April 30th, 2024

## Contents

### Where we left off:

The prep work is done! I've worked through the lower grits of sand paper and
deglosser; now to the fun parts. FYI--I wrote portions of this with ChatGPT. It
was _mostly_ correct in how to handle a project like this, but I'm giving it
some extra flavor and context.

#### Materials Needed:

- Sandpaper (various grits from 60 to 400)
- deglosser (liquid sandpaper) for those tough to reach spots
- Stain (oil-based in my case)
- oil based polyurethane
- mineral spirits
- Brushes or rags for staining
- Clean cloths
- Protective gloves and eyewear

#### Step 1: Preparation

The Robot: Before starting, ensure you’re working in a well-ventilated area.
Clean your desk thoroughly with wood cleaner to remove dust and grime. Once
clean, begin sanding with 60-80-grit sandpaper, focusing on smoothing out rough
areas and removing the old finish. Always sand in the direction of the wood
grain to avoid scratches.

Me: I don't always manage to sand in the same direction--and it mars the surface
in those locations. You'll find out how great your sanding was (or how poor it
was, in my case) when the stain is applied. This step also takes the
longest--the rest of the grits are easy enough to work through by comparison.
The bulk of the sanding work is done on the lower grits during stain removal.
This is where the deglosser can come in handy as well.

#### Step 2: Sanding

Me: Move to finer grits of sandpaper (120 to 220) to smooth the wood further.
220 is where I stop before applying stains and finishes.

#### Step 3: (optional) Applying Wood Conditioner

Robot: This step is essential if you're working with softwoods like pine, which
tend to absorb stains unevenly. Apply a coat of wood conditioner according to
the manufacturer’s instructions; this will help ensure a uniform absorption of
the stain.

Me: The table I'm working on is made out of oak--wood conditioner was
unnecessary, and I like the look that uneven stain absorption creates.

#### Step 4: Staining

Robot: Choose your stain based on the desired color and type of wood. Apply the
stain using a brush or rag, working in manageable sections. Rolltop desks often
have small, intricate areas, so take your time to cover these thoroughly. Wipe
away excess stain with a clean cloth, again following the grain of the wood.
Allow the stain to dry completely, as per the stain instructions, usually
overnight.

Me: I use disposable rags to apply stain--red oak for this project. Work stain
in small sections--too big and the stain gets splotchy and uneven. One rag holds
the stain, and another wipes up the excess. Use gloves and wear clothes you
don't care about for this and the following steps!

Here's what that looks like:

# Austin, a lazy local's suggestions

March 27th, 2024

## This week

I'm sharing a few of my Austin favorites this week. I've lived in Central Texas
all of my life, and I've lived in Austin well over a decade. I'm not a food
blogger by trade, but writing a blog about food technically makes me a food
blogger--so here we are.

## [Comedor](https://comedortx.com/menu/)

Comedor's a great place--I love this restaurant. Fun wine list, great
atmosphere, interesting entrees and shared coursings. Any place with orange
wines on the menu _and_ sensible gluten free, dairy free offerings gets my vote.

I'm not gluten free, but my wife is. Every time we visit, they take care of her,
and they go through extra effort ensure she's able to eat without cross
contamination. It's wonderful.

Don't sleep on their chicken.

## [DipDipDip Tatsu-ya](https://www.dipdipdip-tatsuya.com/menu)

Hot pot rocks.

Go in the middle of the week and avoid the crowds. They offer a fantastic
midweek omakase. All the goodness--half the price. Their menu rotates regularly,
so you'll always have a new addenture ahead of you.

## [Himalaya Kosheli](https://www.himalayakosheli.com/)

I love Himalayan/Tibetan food. Borderline obsessed. It's its own unique cuisine,
with flavors from India and China.

If you'ver never had any Tibetan food, do yourself a favor and order some
Momo--pot stickers--and Thukpa, a tibetan noodle soup. Or the Gobi
Manchurian--fried, spicy cauliflower. All of them are fantastic. Cold weather
comfort food. It's BYOB, so plan accordingly.

That's all for this month. Y'all go snag some food.

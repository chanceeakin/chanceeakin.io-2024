# Building the background, pt.2

January 15th, 2024

## Contents

## Recap

Last time, I covered the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) setup. Today, we will
pick up where we left off: adding randomness. _(Need to catch up?
[Check out the previous post](/blog/building-the-background))._

## Adding Randomness

Now that we have some stars and a styled canvas, it's time to add some
randomness. Programmatic animations combine technical and design elements, and
in order to keep the atmospheric feeling, I need to make some choices.

Namely: how much randomness do we want, and how often do we want it?

I found answers for those questions:

- change the spin and color of the stars.
- change them only on page update.

Here's how that looks in code:

```stars.tsx

export const STAR_COLOR = [
  "#c0c0c0",
  "#3a3a3a",
  "#d946ef",
  "#7a6ded",
  "#591885",
  "#ec4899",
  "#f97316",
];

const pointsArray = new Float32Array(5001);
const add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
const subtract = (a: number, b: number) => a - b;

const spinSpeed = () => (Math.random() < 0.5 ? 25 : 30);
const spinDirection = (): Function => (Math.random() < 0.5 ? add : subtract);
const randomColor = (): string =>
  STAR_COLOR[Math.floor(Math.random() * STAR_COLOR.length)];

const starSpinAndColor = () => ({
  x: [spinDirection(), spinSpeed()],
  y: [spinDirection(), spinSpeed()],
  z: [spinDirection(), spinSpeed()],
  color: randomColor(),
});

export function Stars(props) {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const ref = useRef();
  const [values, setValues] = useState(starSpinAndColor());
  const [sphere] = useState(() => inSphere(pointsArray, { radius: 1 }));

  useEffect(() => {
    setValues(starSpinAndColor());
  }, [pathname]);

  useFrame((_, delta) => {
    ref.current.rotation.x = values.x[0](
      ref.current.rotation.x,
      delta / values.x[1]
    );
    ref.current.rotation.y = values.y[0](
      ref.current.rotation.y,
      delta / values.y[1]
    );
    ref.current.rotation.z = values.z[0](
      ref.current.rotation.z,
      delta / values.z[1]
    );
  });

  return (
    <group rotation={[0, 0, Math.PI / 4]}>
...

```

Let's break this down a bit. In the first section, we have some function and
constant declarations:

```typescript
const pointsArray = new Float32Array(5001);
const add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
const subtract = (a: number, b: number) => a - b;
```

We add an array of floats (divisible by three) to represent our stars. We
perform updates on the array, but we don't have to rebuild the array of points
each time we render the page, so we declare them at the top level of the
component. We also declare an add and subtract function, which will come in
handy in a moment.

In the next few lines, let's add some functions for spin speed and direction, as
well as a color randomizer from the color palette.

```typescript
const spinSpeed = () => (Math.random() < 0.5 ? 25 : 30);
const spinDirection = (): Function => (Math.random() < 0.5 ? add : subtract);
const randomColor = (): string =>
  STAR_COLOR[Math.floor(Math.random() * STAR_COLOR.length)];
```

Last, but not least, we'll stitch them all together into a `starSpinAndColor`
function, which passes updated values for the `x`, `y`, `z`, and `color` keys.

```typescript
const starSpinAndColor = () => ({
  x: [spinDirection(), spinSpeed()],
  y: [spinDirection(), spinSpeed()],
  z: [spinDirection(), spinSpeed()],
  color: randomColor(),
});
```

## Order from chaos

After creating all of those functions, we add them togther into `React`'s
ecosystem, like so:

```updates.tsx
...
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const ref = useRef();
  const [values, setValues] = useState(starSpinAndColor());

  useEffect(() => {
    setValues(starSpinAndColor());
  }, [pathname]);

  useFrame((_, delta) => {
    ref.current.rotation.x = values.x[0](
      ref.current.rotation.x,
      delta / values.x[1]
    );
    ref.current.rotation.y = values.y[0](
      ref.current.rotation.y,
      delta / values.y[1]
    );
    ref.current.rotation.z = values.z[0](
      ref.current.rotation.z,
      delta / values.z[1]
    );
  });
	...

```

We need to know what page we're on, so we use the `usePathname` hook from
`Next.js`. Three.js needs a `ref`, so we create one for it. There's an interplay
between Three.js and React's shadow DOM, and the ref helps them play nicely.

Next, we provide a default state for our animation and color values with the
`useState` hook and `starSpinAndColor` function. This works with the `useEffect`
hook below, updating our animation and color values _only_ when we change the
page (reloads of the page will also trigger a randomization).

Lastly, we pass that data into the `useFrame` hook from
[React Three Fiber's hooks](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/api/hooks#useframe).
This function does some math to update the `x`, `y`, and `z` rotation values of
the stars/Three Canvas on every render. We either add or subtract the current
coordinate with the result of the delta value divided by a randomized spin speed
constant.

> The animation and color values change out on every page navigation, giving us
> a subtle mood shift and unique experience every page.

## Accessible animations

Pretty straightforward stuff here, so long as you're willing to do the work.

Check out
[Josh Comeau's blog post](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/prefers-reduced-motion/)
on `prefers-reduced-motion`, and implement it.

If a website visitor has `prefers-reduced-motion` media query/OS level
preference active, the stars will deactivate. The stars also deactivate on the
blog, because text + lots of twinkling & spinning lights would be too much, and
further, so do all of the `react-spring` based animations.

```BeKindToOneAnother.tsx
export function BackgroundAnimation() {
  const prefersReducedMotion = usePrefersReducedMotion();
  const pathname = usePathname();

	// Blogs and photosensitive folks can have a calmer background.
  if (pathname.includes("blog") || prefersReducedMotion) return null;

  return (
    <Canvas flat shadows camera={{ position: [0, 0, 1] }}>
		...

```

After we turn off the heavy animations, it's worth a check to ensure the rest of
the page is accessible as well. Ensure that you're at 100% accessibility via
[pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/). It's not only the page-ranking
thing to do, _it's also the right thing to do._

Performance is expected to take a hit on mobile, but accessibility should be
unaffected by client differences.

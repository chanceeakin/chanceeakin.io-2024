# Rolltop Desk, part 4

May 30th, 2024

## Contents

## The final countdown

I really thought I'd be done by now--but the final steps require some of the
most care.

#### Step 6: Reassembly and Maintenance

If you disassembled any parts of your rolltop desk, reattach them carefully once
the final coat of finish has fully cured. Maintain the desk by keeping it clean
and dust-free. Use coasters or pads under any items that may scratch the
surface.

#### Final Thoughts

Restoring a rolltop desk can be a rewarding project that not only preserves but
enhances its historical value and aesthetic appeal. With the right materials and
techniques, you can achieve a finish that brings out the natural beauty of the
wood and lasts for years.

Take your time, pay attention to the details, and enjoy the process. Your
rolltop desk will surely be a conversation starter and a cherished piece of
furniture in your home or office.

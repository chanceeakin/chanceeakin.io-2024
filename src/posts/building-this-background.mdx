## Intro

Every so often, I rebuild my portfolio site to reflect current standards. With
the 2024 iteration, I wanted to explore a number of new and mature features in
the React ecosystem. Likewise, the purpose here is twofold. I've set a 2024 goal
to complete 24 blog posts over the year. In doing so, I hope to encourage and
foster my own writing skills. This also helps me accrue experience and building
the writing muscle over time.

Writing is enjoyable--both technical documentation and prose will make their way
into this project by the end of 2024.

For my first entry, I'll begin explaining:

## How I built the background for [chanceeakin.io](https://chanceeakin.io)

If you haven't made it to the homepage yet,
[click this link](https://chanceeakin.io). On it, you _should_ see a nifty
spatial background. Generative art and animation make me happy--I hope they make
you happy too.

Additionally, I had these objectives:

- use Three.js + React Three Fiber.
- provide an atmospheric feeling to the blog.
- incorporate randomness.
- deliever accessible 3D.
- create a performant animation on my home page.

Here's how it went.

### Using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)

If the goal is making 3D web animations,`Three.js` is in use. Or you're ~a
monster~ ~fanatic~ an enthusiast who's porting the original Roller Coaster
Tycoon to WASM.

For the rest of us mortals, we're building on top of someone else's work to do
the fun stuff we want to do--I'm no exception. To build my animations, I used
Three.js and React Three Fiber.

#### What does Three.js do?

Three.js creates scenes. Scenes consist of objects and lights. Objects have
materials/meshes, which provide the "skin" of the object. Then Three.js hooks
into WebGL to render scenes, and updates at 60 FPS via the
`requestAnimationFrame` API.
[Here's their example.](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene)

Since I'm writing React, I need a translation layer.
[React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)
fit the bill nicely. It does everything vanilla `Three.js` does, but with React
component flair, abstracting the extra work away from the developer. It's pretty
sweet and makes writing 2D/3D animations straightforward. The biggest problem:
_translating Three.js examples from plain JS into React_.

My solution? No magic. Just hammer it out until it works and rewrite the cool
stuff by hand. I went line by line and translated from plain JS/TS into the
React counterparts. It was tedious, but the labor bore fruit.

### Providing that atmospheric feeling

After some experimentation, I landed on a fixed camera + a collection of points.
Three.js generates the points like so:

```stars.tsx
import { inSphere } from "maath/random";
import { Points, PointMaterial } from "@react-three/drei";

const sphereArr = new Float32Array(5001);

export function Stars(props) {
  const [sphere] = useState(() => inSphere(sphereArr, { radius: 1 }));
  return (
    <group rotation={[0, 0, Math.PI / 4]}>
      <Points
        {...props}
        ref={ref}
        positions={sphere}
        stride={3}
        frustumCulled={false}
      >
        <PointMaterial
          transparent
          color={values.color}
          size={0.0035}
          sizeAttenuation={true}
          depthWrite={false}
        />
      </Points>
    </group>
  );
}

```

Given an array of points, build out a sphere via `maath/random` and add them
into the Points component provided by `@react-three/drei`. Flexibile and
straightforward.

Next time, we'll dive into how I introduced randomness, accessibility, and made
the background performant.

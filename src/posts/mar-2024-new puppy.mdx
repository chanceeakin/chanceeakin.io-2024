# New Dog!

March 17th, 2024

### Dog update

After several weeks of back and forth, we have a new dog. His name is
Beauregard, and he's a golden retriever.

He sleeps pretty well, and he's attentive. I love golden retrievers--they're
trainable and good natured. So far, he enjoys eating, drinking, wrestling with
Huckleberry, and chewing anything and everything that has a string.

#### Future Blog Posts

I'm debating on starting a series on some sort of tech, but I could also just as
easily start a series on fishing or dog training. Mainly, I'm doing what I can
to exercise a writing muscle. Forcing myself to publish in an effort to hone my
writing.

As I think about it, I still need to extend the functionality of this site in
order to track viewership, bugs, and user sentiment. Comments would be pretty
cool too.

Those are some blog topics I could expound upon in the coming weeks, as well as
covering some topic that's been interesting me for another longer series.

To close today's post, I'll leave you with a picture of Huckleberry &
Beauregard. They're good boys.

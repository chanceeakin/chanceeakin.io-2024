#### Step 5: Applying the Finish

Once the stain has dried and you're satisfied with the depth of color, itâ€™s time
to apply a finish. Polyurethane is a popular choice for its durability and ease
of application. Apply the first coat with a fine-bristle brush or a foam
applicator. Allow this coat to dry, then lightly sand with 220-grit sandpaper to
remove any bumps or imperfections.

Apply a second coat (and a third if needed) following the same method. Each
layer should add depth and protection to the wood. Make sure each coat is
thoroughly dry before applying the next. This could take several hours to a full
day depending on humidity and temperature.

#### Step 6: Reassembly and Maintenance

If you disassembled any parts of your rolltop desk, reattach them carefully once
the final coat of finish has fully cured. Maintain the desk by keeping it clean
and dust-free. Use coasters or pads under any items that may scratch the
surface.

#### Final Thoughts

Restoring a rolltop desk can be a rewarding project that not only preserves but
enhances its historical value and aesthetic appeal. With the right materials and
techniques, you can achieve a finish that brings out the natural beauty of the
wood and lasts for years.

Take your time, pay attention to the details, and enjoy the process. Your
rolltop desk will surely be a conversation starter and a cherished piece of
furniture in your home or office.

### Step 5: Applying the Finish

Continuing on from last time, we're onto finish! My AI assistant has a few
things to say on finishing:

AI: Once the stain has dried and you're satisfied with the depth of color, it’s
time to apply a finish. Polyurethane is a popular choice for its durability and
ease of application. Apply the first coat with a fine-bristle brush or a foam
applicator. Allow this coat to dry, then lightly sand with 220-grit sandpaper to
remove any bumps or imperfections.

Apply a second coat (and a third if needed) following the same method. Each
layer should add depth and protection to the wood. Make sure each coat is
thoroughly dry before applying the next. This could take several hours to a full
day depending on humidity and temperature.

Me: Well, the AI is correct, but I took a different path. Oil based poly can be
finicky, especially with multiple coats. Humidity and temperature both greatly
affect drying times, and shortened drying times adversely affect finish quality.
More humidity equals longer drying time, and more heat shortens drying time.
It's May in Texas--temperature and humidity are all over the map. It was really
tough to have guaranteed minimums for drying time, so I bough myself a bit of a
guarantee: making my own wipe-on polyurethane.

Oil based polyurethane can be thinned with mineral spirits, and thinning with a
2:1 (poly/mineral spirits) provides a thinner, easier to use finish. Application
is easier--all you have to do is "wipe it on" with a rag or cloth. No issues
with back brushing or making sure application is correct the first time. Sand
with 400 grit between coats to knock down the dust burrs or bubbles, and voilà!
A finished table.

Only caveat: wipe-on poly requires more applied coats to build up a sufficient
finish. I'm at 5 coats for the finished product. It looks pretty great.

### Where I'm at Now

At the time of this writing, I have both the body and most of the rolltop
finished. No photos this go round--saving it for the final (hopefully!) post on
the matter. Until next time y'all!
